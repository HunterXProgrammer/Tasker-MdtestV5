- Added support to link WhatsApp using phone number pairing method

### Changes in Mdtest V5 Compared To Previous V4
- Now can link WhatsApp using phone number pairing method.  
  **(Old V4)** Previous method of scanning QR code was tiresome and needed a spare device.  
  **(New V5)** Now with the new pairing method everything is done from the main device in a few seconds.
- Better support for sending images/videos/audio.  
  **(Old V4)** Previously needed to send an image thumbnail seperately along with the main media file.  
  **(New V5)** Now no longer necessary, Mdtest(V5) handles it.
- Added support for receiving media messages and downloading the media file. 
  - Includes downloading images/videos/audio/documents/status/contacts/links/location previews.
    - To enable receiving media messages and downloading media in **Tasker** set variable **`%save_media` = `true`**  
      The media files are stored in **`/data/data/net.dinglisch.android.taskerm/files/whatsmeow5/mdtest.7774/media`** **(where `7774` = `%port`)**
    - To enable receiving media messages and in **Terminal(Termux)** pass the **`--save-media`** flag when starting `mdtest`.  
      The media files are stored in **`~/whatsmeow5/mdtest/media`**
- Added support to send link preview messages.  
  Only for websites that support the **[Open Graph](https://ogp.me/)** protocol.  
  **Eg:- `https://github.com/HunterXProgrammer/Tasker-MdtestV5`**

# Instructions
### For Tasker Users
TODO

### For CLI Users
**NOTE:-**
>This section is helpful for those who want to make shell scripts to use `mdtest` to send messages
>
> Not recommended for Tasker beginners since there are ready made Taskernet links in the Tasker Reddit Post that you can import.

#### CLI In Tasker
TODO

#### CLI In Termux
CLI Setup:-

1\) Install and open **[Termux](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)** in your device.

2\) Grab the pre-compiled  binary from **[releases](https://github.com/HunterXProgrammer/Tasker-MdtestV5/releases/tag/MdtestV5-Assets)** or use the build script to compile it yourself in Termux.

**Eg:-** Depending on your device architecture(use `uname -m` to find out), you can download for `arm`,`arm64`(aarch64),`x86` and `x86_64` like this -

    arch=arm64 && curl -L -o "mdtest-${arch}.zip" "https://github.com/HunterXProgrammer/Tasker-MdtestV5/releases/download/MdtestV5-Assets/mdtest-${arch}.zip" && mkdir -p ~/whatsmeow5/mdtest && unzip -o -d ~/whatsmeow5/mdtest mdtest-${arch}.zip && chmod -R 744 ~/whatsmeow5/mdtest/mdtest

OR

You can build and compile it by yourself in Termux -

    rm -rf Tasker-MdtestV5 &>/dev/null
    git clone https://github.com/HunterXProgrammer/Tasker-MdtestV5
    cd Tasker-MdtestV5
    bash build_whatsmeow5.sh
    cd ..
    
3\) After that link with WhatsApp like this -

>Now to connect it to WhatsApp -
>
>Type -
>
>`cd ~/whatsmeow5/mdtest; ./mdtest pair-phone 919876543210`
>
>(Here "91" is the country code and "9876543210" is the number. Adjust as needed)
>
>This will generate the linking code.
>
>You can copy the linking code and paste it in WhatsApp via notification
>
>or by open WhatsApp -> â‹® (menu) -> Linked Devices -> Link with phone number
>
>Wait about 15s for pairing to complete. All done.

This finishes the CLI setup.

Your script will look like this -

    #!/data/data/com.termux/files/usr/bin/bash
    cd ~/whatsmeow5/mdtest
    ./mdtest FLAGS COMMAND PARAMETERS

### Commands And Parameters

The **FLAGS** are -

    --mode <value>
          Select mode: none, both or send
          (default option: none)
          - both -> Mdtest will receive mesages and as well as send messages
          - send -> Mdtest will only send messages, not receive.
    
    --save-media
          Download And Save Media.
          - This flag also enables receiving media message types
            such as:- images, videos, audio, documents, contacts,
            status, location previews.
          - Media saved to ~/whatsmeow5/mdtest/media
          - Note:- To be used in conjuction with "--mode <value>"
                   Will only be effective if "<value>" is "both"
    
    --port <value>
          Port can be anything from 1024 ~ 65535
          It must not be 9990
          (default option: 7774)
          - Mdtest accepts requests on this port.
          - Note:-  To be used in conjuction with "--mode <value>"
                    Will only accept requests if "<value>" is "both" or "send"
    
    --auto-delete-media
          Delete Downloaded Media After 30s
          - Useful for auto-deleting rubbish media that probably won't
            ever be used.
          - The idea is that if the user doesn't use the
            downloaded media after 30s, save space by deleting
            what is most likely redundant files.
          - Note:- To be used in conjunction with "--save-media"

**Eg:-** 1234567890987654321@g.us
